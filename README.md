# Matplotlib-Challenge
In this assignment challenge, I analyzed data from an animal study conducted by a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. The purpose of the analysis was to compare the efficacy of the drug Capomulin against other drug regimens in treating a potential type of skin cancer.

I conducted the data analysis using pandas and matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook. I have also included a written report in the top markdown cell, summarising the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

The Jupyter Notebook file is located in the ‘Pymaceuticals’ folder with the same title. Additionally, the data used in the analysis can be found in the 'Data' sub-folder, containing two CSV files named ‘Mouse_metadata’ and ‘Study_results.’ It's important to note that the data was provided by edX Bootcamps LLC.
