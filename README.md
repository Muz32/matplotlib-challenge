# Matplotlib-Challenge
"In this assignment challenge, I analyzed data from an animal study conducted by a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. The purpose of the analysis was to compare the efficacy of the drug Capomulin against other drug regimens in treating a potential type of skin cancer.

I performed the data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook file is located in the ‘Pymaceuticals’ folder with the same title. Additionally, the data used in the analysis can be found in the 'Data' sub-folder, containing two CSV files named ‘Mouse_metadata’ and ‘Study_results.’ It's important to note that the data was provided by edEx Bootcamp LLC.
